# JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation

This UFO sighting searching website allowes users to search through a huge UFO sighting dataset for specific information with multiple search categories 


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, created web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Used a date form in HTML document and written JavaScript code that  listens for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
